# Use regular json to read in the names.json file to a list called "names".


# Define a "Student" class that has three parameters: name, grade_level,
# and gpa. name is a str, grade_level is an int, and gpa is a float.


# Create a list of "Student" objects using the "names" list from earlier
# to generate the names. Assign each student a random grade level from 1
# to 12. Assign each student a GPA between 0.0 and 4.0.


# Find the "Student" object with your name in the list and serialize into
# a "me.json" file.


# Serialize the whole list of students into a "students.json" file.
